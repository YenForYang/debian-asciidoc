asciidoc (8.6.9-4) unstable; urgency=low

  The asciidoc package has been split into several other packages to
  bring more flexibility and to lower the dependencies for people using only
  man pages and html files generation. (Closes: #692274, #637006)
  The asciidoc binary package is now a meta package that brings
  asciidoc-dblatex and others packages to keep the current behavior.
