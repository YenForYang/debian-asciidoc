Description: Minimal version of asciidoc not suitable for pdf
 AsciiDoc is a text document format for writing articles, books, manuals and
 UNIX man pages. AsciiDoc files can be translated to HTML (with or without
 stylesheets), DocBook (articles, books and refentry documents) and LinuxDoc
 using the asciidoc command. AsciiDoc can also be used to build and maintain
 websites.
 .
 You write an AsciiDoc document the same way you would write a
 normal text document, there are no markup tags or weird format notations.
 AsciiDoc files are designed to be viewed, edited and printed directly or
 translated to other presentation formats
 .
 This package provides binary files for the package. Be careful, you won't
 be able to build pdf files without the dblatex or fop dependencies. See
 asciidoc-dblatex or asciidoc-fop metapackages for this.
